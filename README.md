# WeierstrassAudioParadox
Demonstrate the weird and wonderful auditory paradoxes caused by audio generated from Weierstrass functions

The sound isn't very pleasant to listen to, but, demonstrates the point.

Demo of the Weierstrass function used to generate a chord, where playing back at double the speed doesn't make the sound an octave higher! When using 2 and it's at an almost identical pitch, it plays the same pitch but also simultaneously is an octave higher, which is wild.

And for fun, another paradox: If you detune octaves slightly (not using a Weierstrass function) then playback at double the speed. The resulting sound is lower not an octave higher!
